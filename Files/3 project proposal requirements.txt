Project proposal requirements
=============================

Page 1 content:
---------------

* Title of the project
* Names of members of the team
* Project description in 2-3 paragraphs
(usually 10-15 lines) - do NOT copy&paste from Wikipedia or other sources.
* Bullet-point list of:
- technologies used,
- special features,
- additional libraries,
- challenging items that were not done in class, etc.

NOTE: Proposal is NOT A COMMITMENT.
This is a basis for discussion.
Put in rather more than less.

NOTE: No copy&paste from Wikipedia or other such sources.

IMPORTANT: You must list the Routes you'll be handling.
/Login
/Register
/ (index)
/Admin
/Admin/Users CRUD


Page 2 content:
---------------

Design of the database. You may use Visual Studio or MS SQL database designer
and take a screenshot similar to http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQxfY.png

Try to keep it simple - no more than 3-8 tables.

You may also use a NO-SQL database.


Page 3-4 content (2 pages):
--------------------------------

Mockups or snapshots of web pages that illustrate how user will interact with the program.

Do NOT put Login or three-field registration pages here.



Generally not more than 4 pages.

On the 5th page you must put a list of questions to discuss with the teacher.

LATER: UPLOAD IT TO LEA AS WELL (for the record)
*AFTER* APPROVED BY THE TEACHER.
