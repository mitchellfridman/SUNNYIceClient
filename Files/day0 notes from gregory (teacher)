Vague Notes about when we asked Gregory questions day0


-many to many table,
	seperate tables,


-varchar as an array of flavors for fav under account

	WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2)




-fav tally, use a trigger to increment
	or ... program in backend

-for cones, many to many seperate tables, cones belong to the order

-use a loop to choose how many cones with whats already in your cart

-we need URL + admin

-admin manages flavors and manages orders
